            <p>In this first paragraph we gonna explain all the incredible things that you can do with the branches on Git. Any number of developers can work a code separately, in different branches one for each necessary change to be made, and when they finish the changes unify their codes back to the principal or "master" code. </p>
            <p>Also, do you know that the best way to share your ideas and news is through a blog?. Better than conferences and YouTube videos. Except if you are a rockstar. Think twice if you are a rockstar, but because right now you are not, feel free to go and share your experiences.... just for now, until you became one.</p>
